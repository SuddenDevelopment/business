I have hired, interviewed and dealt with the consequences of hiring mistakes enough to develop crtieria and processes I find that work well. These are not particularly original. I've read several boks and articles on the subject and discussed it with many people.

# Methodology

Just talk to the person. All of the important criteria can easily be checked off suring a casual conversation. Occasionally, I need to transition back to a subject or work something in. Having a questionaire is too rigid. Every conversation I have covers all of the necessary topics, gets into details where they are most beneficial and transitions to topics pretty easily. Most people will recognize the actual questions inside of the conversation, but will be more comfortable and talk more. I want someone to talk as much as possible it will often tell me so much more than answers to a question.

# Criteria

- Integrity: If you can't trust someone the rest doesn't matter. I'm not talking about the loyalty and devotion startups try to create. I just mean that they are honest and ethical. I can trust what they say, get honest and direct answers, and they will act in the best interests of the company while employed.
-- tested by: fact checking, BS level, openness in conversation, the persons own admission of ork ethics.
- Passion: Do they have a passion for what you are doing or need them to do? IS there evidence of this beyond them saying so in an interview? For example: there's a lot of open source free software with tutorials and lots of help on getting started. If someone says they are passionate about something where the only cost is time, they should have some experience in it. If someone is truly passionate about the subject you need them to be a lot of other thins fall into place.
-- tested by: what they do and study without pay or little encouragement.
- Discipline: people can't always be working on what they have a passion for. Sometimes they need to work. For those times I need to know I can count on the person to get through obstacles and any required tedium.
-- tested by: Usually mentiond in a conversation, such as they quit because they had to do too much boring work. It's usually easy to think of what is the most common tedious task they would have to do and ask them when they did it last and how it went.
- Resilience: This one is not often in peoples top 5. This is the ability for a person to work under pressure, work through tough times, not easily be offended, and generally have a high tolerance for BS. I never like to see this quality tested in employees, it means things need to be corrected. However, it's probable. I need some level of confidence that people can last long enough for things to be improved in a reasonable timeframe. It also helps if they genuinely want to be part of the solution.

That's it. Skills and experience are needed for certain levels and positions, but I find they are never a match in the long run for the above criteria. I've seen people with above criteria learn a new programming language, learn a project, improve that project and provide more lasting value than their peer that had a head start in the same language and product. These are the people you can count on, they are consistent and honest.
