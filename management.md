  My first introduction to Leadership as a serious subject was in the Marine Corps. They have lots of acronyms and examples, overall it's too regimented for the corporate world. I did take away 2 things that were drilled into my head:

"You only have 2 things to worry about: 1. Mission accomplishment 2. Troop Welfare , in that order. In peace time you reverse the order"

  I read a lot into that. There's no restrictions based on what resources you have, CYA, what the scenario is or what excuses you can come up with. Just get it done and take care of your people.

  I find the toughest part about translating this simple code into the corporate world is that the missions are often undefined below the level of "Profit" and the success criteria of those missions are even less likely to be defined. This leads me to often be a person that needs to ask for or build strawmen for creating such definitions that can be accomplished by teams.

# Top Leadership Qualities

1. *Know your subject* It's difficult to lead saying "I am the people manager" it leaves too much room for people to mislead my decisions.
2. *Be a force multiplier* I am there to make the whole greater than the sum of parts. Otherwise, I should be an individual contributor.
3. *Lead from the front* I work WITH teams. They dont work for me. When I can contribute something I do. I listen, try my best to remove obstacles and setup the best possible path for success for the team and individuals.
4. *Raise others up* I work to give people a successful path. Many times that path leads way outside of my direct influence. Helping people be successful builds a loyal and cohesive team. Seeing others set up to succeed and benefiting from it is very motivating to do the same.
